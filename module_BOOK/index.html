<li class="list-group-item"><b>George RR Martin</b> : <font color="green">A Clash of Kings</font> : Song of Ice and Fire 2: Still a very good series. Will continue reading (Sept13)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Reilly, Matthew</b> : <font color="green">Contest</font> : From Elaine.  The cover looked like a police procedural, but it turned out to be sci fi almost teenage lit. Very good summer read though (Jun13)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Michael Ondaatje</b> : <font color="green">The English Patient</font> : Recommended by Tuula.I wasn't too impressed by this story. As I was reading I could recognise that it was well written but I just felt detatched from the story. Jun2013</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>George RR Martin</b> : <font color="green">Game Of Thrones</font> : From Sanna (Linus's mum). Excellent story. Epic. Lots of characters and intertwining storylines. Twists. Everything needed for me to buy number 2 in the series (May13)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Erin Morgenstern</b> : <font color="green">The Night Circus</font> : Brilliant. Enchanting. Magical. A circus which opens at nigtht and is enfused with magic. It is there to be a stage on which 2 magicians can fulfil a challenge which their mentors trained them for. Stunning book. Will read again. Mar13</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Sansom, CJ</b> : <font color="green">Heartstone</font> : Excellent as always. This time the Queen wants Shardlake to investigate something down near Portsmouth when the Frnech are invading England. He is on the Mary Rose when it sinks. A really good 'historical fiction' note there. Roll on the 6th book! (Feb13)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Rankin, Ian</b> : <font color="green">Standing in Another Man's Grave</font> : Rebus is back. Very good as always. I hope the series continues. This was based around dissapearances around the A9 Perth to Inverness via Pitlochry (Jan13)</li>

<li class="list-group-item"><b>Nesbo, Jo</b> : <font color="green">The Redbreast</font> : First of series. Quite difficult to get into but I didn't have  much time to read it so only read a few pages at a time. I'll try the next one anyway.</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Fry, Stephen</b> : <font color="green">Moab is my Washpot</font> : Excellent autobiography of Stephen Fry's first 20 years. Very well written and heart wrenching.. his life was quite ordinary but at the same time extraordinary.</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Reynolds, Alistair</b> : <font color="green">Blue Remembered Earth</font> : Excellent. First of Reynolds new trilogy. Geoffrey lives in Africa nad is about to experiment with mind joining with elphants. He is caught up in his space travel, aquatic cities and a discovery about his dead grandmother who lived in a space habitat for all her life.. or so he believes. Looking forward to the next books in this series.... (Oct12)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Trotter, William R</b> : <font color="green">The Winter War</font> : Stunning. Well written book which explains, documents and discusses the 1939-1940 Winter War between Russia and Finland. It also clears up the history around Finland's alliance with Germany during the 2nd World War. This book should be re-read every few years as it swells with Finnish spirit and sisu (Sept12)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Reynolds, Alistair</b> : <font color="green">Zima Blue</font> : Fantastic collection of short stories with epic SF themes, spanning Reynolds 20 year career. Can't get enough of this author.</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Pratchett, Terry</b> : <font color="green">The Long Earth</font> : Well.. it was ok, but nothing mind blowing. It was quite childishly written and it's obviously the start of a series. think I'll leave it. Twas all about people 'stepping' to millions of parallel worlds.</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Cornwell, Bernard</b> : <font color="green">Sharpes Story</font> : Short book by the author of Sharpe about the series. Very good little book. Also a small biography about him being adoped into the 'Peculiar' people. A Christian fundamentalist family... and how they turned him off religion for good :P</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Reynolds, Alistair</b> : <font color="green">Galactic North</font> : 8 short stories about Felka, Clavain, Worms, All tied together. Well worth the read</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Sansom, CJ</b> : <font color="green">Revelation</font> : Excellent again. Shardlake is a very 3 dimensional antihero. the story concerns him catching a seriel killer that is using the '7 deadly vials' in the book of Revelation as a template.</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Channel, AR</b> : <font color="green">The Phantom Patrol</font> : Found this out-of-print book from 1940 on Australian ebay. My Dad has talked about it for years as a favourite. Set in Finnish Lapland at the outbreak of the 1939 Winter War when Petsamo was over run by Russia. Really nice to read as a 'boy's own' scout story as a group of Finns. Lapps and an English teenager disrupt Russian arny attempts by destoyign railway bridges, rescuing prisoners and other 'heroic acts'. The whole book is written with with an 2d anti-Russia pro-stiff-upper-lip and the Finns are characterised as stoic underdogs bathed in ancestral culture.. wonderful stuff! (Apr12)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Reynolds, Alistair</b> : <font color="green">Diamond Dogs, Turquoise Days</font> : 2 novellas set in the Revelation Space universe. Diamond Dogs was a very nice compact gothic tale which uses the film 'Cube' as source. Very nicely done. Turquise Days is set on a 'Juggler' world where the sea is full of semi-intelligent organisms and humans swim with them to communicate. A kind of set piece story about a key species in Revelation Space. Very good again. (Apr12)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Hosseini, Khaled</b> : <font color="green">A Thousand Splendid Suns</font> : Very well written story focussing on the treatment of women, and the refugee status of many Afghanistans, in Kabul as power is transferred from governments to local warlords to Taliban and back to warlords. Emotionally wrenching and graphically written. I love books of this quality. (Apr12)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Thompson, James</b> : <font color="green">Lucifer's Tears</font> : This was a good read. The author sometimes stretches the dialog a bit .. giving thinly veiled lectures on The Winter War, Mannerheim and the Finnish language and culture translation into English is a bit clunky sometimes but maybe that's just because all of this is old ground to me. Quite funny that he describes a birth at Naistenklinnikka exactly where Sampo was born :P (Mar12)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Sansom, CJ</b> : <font color="green">Sovereign</font> : (3/5) Very good again. Shardlake, the hunchback lawer, is tasked to go up to York to meet with King Henry VIII's 'Progress' (a massive procession to show the king's power to the northern papist rebels). Pretty action packed with an emphasis on imprisonment for those that oppose the king. Shardlake is tortured in the tower of London .. quie good, gritty description (Mar12)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Thompson, James</b> : <font color="green">Snow Angels</font> : 1/3 Finland based crime novels. I enjoyed this very much. Quite a nuts and bolts crime thriller but it was set in Kittila and Levi in the middle of kaamos and so I had the vested interest in reading English language crime thriller set in Finland (which describes the book that is currently slowly developing inside me). I'll read the other 2 in the series. Quick read (Feb12)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Reynolds, Alistair</b> : <font color="green">The Prefect</font> : (5/5 Revelation Space books) Stunning part 5 of this series. The "Prefects" are the space security police with the responsibility of looking after a massive planet and the 'Glitterband' ring of 10000 orbiting habitats. A mass murder of one of the habitats triggers an epic space opera including lots of bad guys and a couple of excellent super baddies! Some new technologies (Whiphounds... personal police weapons) and some very touching setpieces and twists. The beheading (and then re-attachment) of the 'head' prefect matriarch figure to save her from the Clockmaker's attached Scarab timebomb device is genius. (Feb12)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Cornwell, Bernard</b> : <font color="green">Death of Kings</font> : (Saxon Stories 6/6) Excellent again. Alfred dies and leaves the country at war with the Danes about to launch a full scall attack. Uhtred is getting a bit older but still leads Saxon armies against the Danes. I think there will be another in this series (Feb12)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Jenkins, Jerry</b> : <font color="green">Left Behind</font> : This is from the same writing stable as Dan Brown/DaVinciCode. 2D characters who all talk in over-dramatic Americanised statements. I do like the idea of using the book of Revelation as a structure for a whole series of books. This first book describes all the Christians (and kids under 12, babies and unborn children) suddenly vanishing in the rapture when Christ takes them to heaven. A world leader starts to appear and gain power (will become the Antichrist in later books) (Jan12)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Fry, Stephen</b> : <font color="green">The Fry Chronicles</font> : Excellent and intimate autobiography covering Stephen Fry's 20th-30th years, and (briefly) his childhood. Some very revealing and funny stuff. Lots of dtails about Cambridge that I loved having lived in Cambridge and Paula having been a student in it's hallowed halls. (Jan12)</li>

<li class="list-group-item"><b>Reynolds, Alistair</b> : <font color="green">Absolution Gap</font> : (4/5 Revelation Space books) Excellent again. This series is fantastic. Plenty of twists and excellent new technologies and ideas to stretch your mind and imagination. Also action and set pieces are done brilliantly. Apparently this is the best of the 5 books. Let's see when I read the last one! (Dec11 (New Year's Eve!))</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Clements, Jonathan</b> : <font color="green">Mannerheim: President, Soldier, Spy</font> : Fantastic biography. Well written with attention to detail balanced with pace and plenty of informative maps and photographs of Mannerheim's life. I read this book as Finland was celebrating Independence Day when Mannerheim is remembered for taking the reins to defend Finland's new autonomy against red-russia after the 1917 uprising. He also led the 1940 winter war to stop Russia taking Finnish territory (which is a magnificent piece of Finnish history). I should reread this book every 5 years or so. (Dec11)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Hosseini, Khaled</b> : <font color="green">The Kite Runner</font> : Ipad2 book. Fantastically written, emotional, perfect plot arc beautifully and naturally brought to a satisfying conclusion. must read for anyone with a heart. The focus at the end of the book is a small helpless child (Sohrab) who tugs at the heart strings and is a lovely character. I was reading this in hospital when our first baby was born and the mixture of emotions made this book very special. I will read more from this author. (Nov11)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Sansom, CJ</b> : <font color="green">Dark Fire</font> : (2/5) Reall nice to read these detective stories set in 1540s. All the historical elements are very well included (for example the idea that all elements are made of earth, water, fire and air) and the action is exciting. The hunchback lawyer is a master stroke of characterization.. very well written.. looking forward to the next books in this series. (11.11.11)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Rajaniemi, Hannu</b> : <font color="green">Quantum Thief</font> : Jouni suggested. A little bit too hard core sci-fi for me. It was obviously well written and mostly very good with some excellent ideas, but I had to concentrate too much on following the new technologies and ideas. Too much sci-fi bang and not enough plot and action for me (Nov11)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Pratchett, Terry</b> : <font color="green">Snuff</font> : This was quite average for Pratchett. It was still very funny and gave that old 'warm feeling' inside when reading it but there was nothing very new and inventive. A big part of the story relied on the same jokes you would find in Jeeves and Wooster and there was nothing particularly 'Discwoldy' happening until 35% into it (I know this because my iPad deals in % not pages :P)(Nov11)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Cornwell, Bernard</b> : <font color="green">The Burning Land</font> :  (Saxon Stories 5/6) Excellent again. Historical fiction with plenty of action, battles and blood and guts. The Danes are invading 'England' and Uthred is a Alfred's warlord commanding piecemeal armies to stop them (Oct11)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Sansom, CJ</b> : <font color="green">Dissolution</font> : (1/5) Very good story. Very similar to The Name of The Rose. Hunchback Shardlake is sent from Cromwell to investigate a death at a monastary. I'll probably read this whole series (Sept11)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Bryson, Bill</b> : <font color="green">At Home</font> : Excellent. Well written. Each chapter is loosely connected to each room in his house. Full of really interesting details from history (Sept11))</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Reynolds, Alistair</b> : <font color="green">Redemption Ark</font> : (3/5 Revelation Space books) These books are getting better and better. The wolves/inhibitors are about to wipe out humanity culling any intelligent life before it gets too far into space. Various parties are trying to get control of a collection of "Hell class" weapons to mount a defense against the wolves (Aug11)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Morris, Donald R</b> : <font color="green">The Washing Of The Spears: The Rise and Fall of the Zulu Nation Under Shaka</font> : Very interesting and easy to read, although I lost interest after Shaka's death (about 150 pages in). The book is a massive endevour.. only for those *really* interested in the exaustive history of the Zulus. (Aug11)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Joensuu, Matti</b> : <font color="green">To Steal Her Love</font> : Not as good as Priest of Evil but still readable for a summer pageturner (Jul11)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Sansom, CJ</b> : <font color="green">Chasm City</font> : (2/5 Revelation Space books) 1st Ipad2 book. Excellent stand alone story from the 'Revelation Space' series. I finished this and started Redemption Ark immediatly. Reynolds is intelligent, non-patronising and really makes you think about what you are reading.. and these space operas are still action packed and witty. Loving them! (Jul11)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Joensuu, Matti</b> : <font color="green">Priest of Evil</font> : Decent crime story. Really refreshing to read a book set in Helsinki, so I could picture all the scenes. Will probably read more of this author (Jun11)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Garcia Marquez, Gabriel</b> : <font color="green">Love In The Time Of Cholera</font> : Lovely story about a man's love for a woman from early childhood to old age set in some fictional Carribean location. Very atmospheric and a few truelly beautifully described moments. Lots of various love affairs, noteably the woman who liked to suck different dummy tits and the mad woman from an institution :) (Jun11)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Reynolds, Alistair</b> : <font color="green">Revelation Space</font> : (1/5 Revelation Space books) Stunning space opera spanning time, space, civilizations and also packed with action. I've already downloaded Chasm City for as my first Ipad2 book (Jun11)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Reynolds, Alistair</b> : <font color="green">Pushing Ice</font> : Excellent, epic sci-fi. An ice-drilling ship (Rockhopper) is sent to follow Janus (a moon of Jupiter) which has suddenly woken up and started to leave the solar system under some unknown power. They get stuck on it and end up millions of years in the future, with various alien races (Fountainheads/Musk Dogs) in a massive 'tube' cage. Will definately read Alistair Reynolds 6 book series. (Mar2011)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Faulks, Sebastian</b> : <font color="green">Birdsong</font> : Excellent story of a soldier in WorldWar1 in the trenches at the Somme. The story jumps 1914 - 1978 - 1918 and was very well written. I read this on holiday in Mauritius. One of the 'top 100' that I intend to slowly plough through (Mar11)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Cornwell, Bernard</b> : <font color="green">Vagabond</font> : (Grail 2/3) Good fast story, including battles in France and Thomas being questioned by the inquisition about his knowledge as to where the Holy Grail is. Straight onto no3 now... (Feb11)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Smith, Wilbur</b> : <font color="green">A Time to Die</font> : (next Courtney after Rage) More actionpacked than usual. Sean Courtney is a seasoned hunter leading a rich guy and his daughter hunting the last old elephant in Africa. Then they get caught up in a guerilla war which involves russian hind helicopters. Good chases and African description. (Feb11)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Sansom, CJ</b> : <font color="green">Heretic</font> : (Grail Quest 3/3) Good end to the trilogy. I'm getting a bit jaded just because I've read so much Bernhard Cornwell. I can now recognise his style of writing and even see how his plot arcs are going to resolve themselves. I think I'll give myself a break before reading another. (Feb11)</li>

<li class="list-group-item"><b>Forester, CS</b> : <font color="green">Hornblower and the Crisis</font> : (unfinished +2 short stories) The last 3 stories of the excellent Hornblower series. Crisis is about Horblower aquiring Napoleon's signature and then planning to use it to send French ships in towards the battle of Trafalgar. Forester died while writing this but his notes give an idea of how it will end. The other 2 short stories were about an Irish rebel trying to send secret documents in a chest back to Ireland and the other story about a 'mad man' claiming to be Napoleon turning up at Hornblower's door, who we later find out to be Napoleon III on his way to France. Hornblower == excellent series. (Dec10)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Irving, John</b> : <font color="green">Setting Free the Bears</font> : Very good first book. Strange literary mix of farce, epic storytelling, whimsical descriptive moments and the Nazi invasion of Austria (Dec2010)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Larsson, Steig</b> : <font color="green">The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest</font> : Very good conclusion to the Millenium trilogy and all the ends were tied up, although there was something 'dull' about it. Larsson was very careful to make all the relationships realistic and mature so there was some 'childishness' lacking. Altogether well worth reading. (Dec2010)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Kermally, Pete</b> : <font color="green">Waiting for the Punchline</font> : My review on Amazon: Pete Kermally is a modern Tom Sharpe, writing with a real understanding of the London comedy circuit and creating set pieces that would make Wilt proud to have staggered through. A very funny story with some unexpected twists and a few very poigniant moments of deep feeling for the characters. 'Waiting for the Punchline' is as funny as his last set of stories 'Entwined' so hopefully we'll see a whole series of good reads from Kermally. Note: your workmates will start to get irritated after about the 4th or 5th retelling of some of the stand-up oneliners from this book :P</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Smith, Wilbur</b> : <font color="green">Rage</font> : Excellent, long, epic story about the rise of black opposition to apartheid in South Africa.. Told from the point of view of Afrikaaners, various tribes and factions. Nice that actual historical figures and events are mingled in (eg. Nelson Mandela is a character in this fictional story). (Nov 2010)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Larsson, Steig</b> : <font color="green">The Girl Who Played with Fire</font> : Nicely written again. The first book was like a 'locked room' murder mystery on the island. This was more like a police procedural with various action set pieces. I like the writing style (of the English version anyway :) and the non-patronising tone of the narrator. Dan Brown should take note. (Oct 2010)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Smith, Roff</b> : <font color="green">Cold Beer and Crocodiles</font> : Very nice diary of a guy cycling anti-clockwise round Australia. Nothing mind blowing.. just a good tale of kangaroos, motels, heat, sheep shearing, desert and a couple of hospital visits (Sept 10)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Forester, CS</b> : <font color="green">Hornblower in the West Indies</font> : Action packed from start to finish. First he intercepts a ship intending to free Napoleon from St Helena, lies on his honour that Boney is dead and then finds out that he is in fact dead. Brilliant twist. Disables and catches a fast slave ship by secretly putting a kind of sea anchor to the rudder before she sets off. Pirates catch him in Jamaica and take him to a cliff face. A young millionaire dupes everyone to allow him to sail into Venezuela and pretend to be Hornblower in the rebel war there. A hurricane hits the ship that Hornblower and Barbara are on and the ship nearly sinks in massive swelling seas and hurricane wind... excellent stuff!! (Sept2010)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Irving, John</b> : <font color="green">Last Night in Twisted River</font> : Loved this. My first John Irving book but nopt the last. This is a long tale of a cook, his son (a writer) and his grandson who need to flee Twisted River when the writer son kills his father's lover thinking she is a bear :P The cooks long time friend Ketchum is the most heroic anti-hero.. excellent characters and some very funny set pieces. I ordered Irving's first book from the library.. here comes another book series for me! (Aug2010)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Fleming, Fergus</b> : <font color="green">Barrow's Boys</font> : Excellently written account of all the expeditions to discover Antarctic, North West Passage, the source of the Nile, Timbuctoo, parts of Australia between 1816 and about 1850. John Barrow was the British Admiralty guy who sent all the explorers to their doom/fame. (Aug2010)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Larsson, Steig</b> : <font color="green">The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</font> : Well plotted. Flawed in parts but worth reading.. maybe DaVinci Code for adults. I've bought the other 2 in the trilogy (Aug10)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Forester, CS</b> : <font color="green">Lord Hornblower</font> : Hornblower is asked to deal with a ship of British mutineers near the coast of France. Then he takes control of a French port as the war ends and Napoleon is imprisoned on Elba. Napoleon escapes to Paris and Hornblower is captured in France. He is about to be executed when the Battle of Waterloo turns the tide for him and he is saved at the last gasp. Excellent story again! (Aug10)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Rankin, Ian</b> : <font color="green">The Complaints</font> : Very good debut of the new Rankin hero as an internal police investigator. Looking forward to the next ones (Jul10)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Forester, CS</b> : <font color="green">The Commodore</font> : Excellent as always. Baltic sea, Finland, St Petersburg, defence of Riga with bomb vessels (Jul10)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Forester, CS</b> : <font color="green">Flying Colours</font> : Good solid story. Starts with Hornblower escaping Frensh captives, holding up for a few months in a French sympathiser's home and excaping downriver with Bush and Brown to the safety of a British blockade ship. His court marshal goes well and he is made Comadore. His wife dies when he's in France and he marries Lady Barbara who has taken care of his son after Marie's death (Jun10)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Rankin, Ian</b> : <font color="green">A Cool Head</font> : This was a 'Quick Read' (some get people reading drive in the Uk I guess). Nothing particularly special, like the draft of a few Rebus chapters cobbled together for a quick publish. (Jun10)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Smith, Wilbur</b> : <font color="green">Power of the Sword</font> : 620 pages so quite epic. Very good story spanning about 20 years from 1930 - 1940 in South Africa. Nelson Mandela and Hitler both turn up and the whole history of Appartheid and prejudice is given a very action packed workover. Excellent stuff although Wilbur Smith's obvious passion for hunting, hairy women and the upper class pursuits (polo, boxing, name dropping all the most expensive makers) still, and I hope will always, irritate the crap out of me. (Jun10)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>McGregor, Jon</b> : <font color="green">If Nobody Speaks of Remarkable Things</font> : Everybody loved this book. It was shortlisted for prizes. I thought it was beautifully written and very poetic but the 'twist' or climax was like a damp squib. Like Blair Witch Project. I had to google for 30 mins to actually find out what had happened.. had I missed something critical?. I hadn't. I've read plenty books that have been magically and poetically written.. but they had plot too (May2010)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Kermode, Mark</b> : <font color="green">Its only a movie</font> : p34 was the first mention of The Excorcist. Anyone who listens to the podcasts will find this quite a surprising display of restraint. Book ws very funny and read just like a long joky conversation about his life. Maybe half of the points you'll know from the radio show.. plenty of interesting little extra stories and anecdotes (Mar10)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Pratchett, Terry</b> : <font color="green">Unseen Academicals</font> : Brilliant. Clever. Subtle. Warm humoured. Unpatronising (take note Mr. Brown). Full of nods to the previous Discworld books. I'm already gagging for the next installment (Mar10)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Forester, CS</b> : <font color="green">A Ship of the Line</font> : Hornblower is getting better and better. This book was full of action. Even the last 10 pages recounted a battle between Hornblowers ship and 4 French ships (which left him dismasted and surrendered). Bring on the next Hornblower I say! (Mar10)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Knecht, C. Bruce</b> : <font color="green">Proving Ground</font> : Highly recommended to anyone. It's a true account of the 1998 Sydney-Hobart(Tasmania) boat race in which 5 men died and ships sank when weather conditions became rediculous. 50 foot waves etc. Scary stuff written in easy documentary style (Feb10)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Brown, Dan</b> : <font color="green">The Lost Symbol</font> : Audiobook (unabridged) Even lazier and less inventive than the other 2 bestsellers. Ok for listening to at airports. I know a 6 year old that could produce more imaginative dialogue, action and suspense than this (Jan10)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Smith, Wilbur</b> : <font color="green">The Burning Shore</font> : Excellent adventure story. Pure escapism with WW2 France and deepest Africa. I'm hooked on Mr Smith now... embarking on the next in the (long) series.. (Jan10)</li>

There seemed too much romanticism about France which generally leaves me cold (Feb09)</li>

Not much ammo and very little chance of success. It get's very bloody and dirty... good ole' Sharpie battle with Harper and Fredrickson at his side (Nov07) </li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Cornwell, Bernard</b> : <font color="green">Excalibur</font> : (Arthur 3/3) Excellent end to the trilogy. Some satisfying battles and the characterisation of Derfel, Arthur, Guinevere, Lancelot, Merlin, Nimue (Merlin's prodigy druid) are all done very well. I loved the ending SPOILER that left the fate of Arthur up to the reader. The format of the trilogy (that Derfel as an old man was writing the history as he remembered it) worked very well and added an extra dimension to the whole kerfuffle. Well done Mr Cornwell.. now I'll continue with the Sharpe series... (Nov07)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Cornwell, Bernard</b> : <font color="green">Sharpe's Regiment</font> : Set mostly in England, Sharpe must find the 2nd Battalion (the recruits for his men in Spain) who are being illegally syphened off to sell by dishonest officers.

<li class="list-group-item"><b>Cornwell, Bernard</b> : <font color="green">Enemy of God</font> :  (Arthur 2/3) Again very impressive, with a few nice twists (Guenivere's alliance to Lancelot being the biggest). I'm looking forward to the last in the trilogy (Excalibur) (Oct07)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Cornwell, Bernard</b> : <font color="green">Sharpe's Honour</font> : Sharpe duels, is accused of murder and therefore 'hanged', rescues the 'golden whore' from a mountaintop convent to clear his name. Comes back from the dead to fight the battle at Vitora, where Wellington surprises the overconfident French by blindsiding them with troops send over trecherous hills days before the battle. The French plunder (millions) is left to Spain/Britain as the French run back up to France. Enemy here were Major Ducos and 'El Maratife' (the Slaughterer). Excellent read... 5 to go. (Sept07)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Cornwell, Bernard</b> : <font color="green">Sharpe's Enemy</font> : Proof of a good series of books=I started this 10 mins after finishing Sharpe's Sword :O) This is a fictional story based around rumours of groups of deserters from all sides (French, British, Portugese, Spanish) turning into roaming gangs. Hakeswill is the 2nd in command of one of these gangs and Sharpe ends up killing him (at last!) after Hakeswill kills Sharpe's wife Teresa (didn't see that coming.. a bit surprising and heart-renching). Sharpe also has prototype rockets to use in the battle.. nice battles again and an excellent image when Harper is secretly hidden in a French-taken fort and bursts out of a pile of skulls and bones to kick French derriere. Fantastic stuff! (Aug07)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Cornwell, Bernard</b> : <font color="green">Sharpe's Sword</font> : Excellent story of espionage.  Sharpe has to protect El Mirador (the central spoke of the British spy network) from the French Colonel Leroux. Sharpe takes a bullet and nearly dies, Harper makes him a sword and Wellington kick's Boney's backside in the battle of Battle of Salamanca by tricking him into thinking that the whole British army was only a few batallions (defeated an army of 40,000 men in 40 minutes). Excellent story as always. (Aug07)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Billingham, Mark</b> : <font color="green">Death Message</font> : This is the 7th DI Thorne book. Quite a standard police procedural with a few nice touches.

A killer is on the loose (The Meatman) (Portuagal Jul07)</li>

(Jul07)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Cornwell, Bernard</b> : <font color="green">Sharpe's Battle</font> : Good story focussed on the 3 day battle at the small village of Fuentes de Onoro, 1811.

(May 07)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Cornwell, Bernard</b> : <font color="green">The Winter King</font> : (Arthur 1/3)Excellent telling of the Arthur legend with plenty memorable characters and places. Told in first person by one of Arthur's warriors (Derfel Cadarn). This story covers Arthur's marriage to Guinevere and the battles between British clans and with the invading Saxon hordes. Merlin is also included as the 'master druid' who is looking for the 13 'Treasures of Britain'. Much description of the religions of the time (Christianity, Druidism and other polytheistic beliefs). Looking forward to the next 2 in the trilogy (May 07)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Cornwell, Bernard</b> : <font color="green">Sharpe's Fury</font> : Winter 1811, the war seems lost. All Spain has fallen to the French, except for Cdiz (Spanish capital). Spanish refuse to fight with British on hill south of Cadiz. Priest is blackmailing British with letters from Sir Arthur Wellesleys brother Henry to a beautiful whore. This was Crornwell's 21st book in the series (newest to date but chronologically number 11 in the series) and some critics say that he's running out of fresh ideas. I agree that it's quite formulaic but I still love the fact/fiction/adventure mix and will keep reading the series (Mar07)</li>

<li class="list-group-item"><b>Cornwell, Bernard</b> : <font color="green">Harlequin</font> : (Grail Quest 1/3) Excellent writing.. very like the action in Sharpe but set much earlier.

Thomas of Hookton leaves his native Dorset to fight aginst the French in Brittany and, afterwards, at the battle of Crecy.

<li class="list-group-item"><b>Cornwell, Bernard</b> : <font color="green">Sharpe's Escape</font> : #10 Excellent again.. longer than usual. I'm loving the historical detail Cornwell puts into these books. The battles and military detail are all fact and some of it is very harrowing. The British and their Portuguese allies see off the French assault at Bussaco ridge, Sharpe has a private feud with the criminal Ferragus, whom he pursues from the abandoned town of Coimbra (where he destroys his warehouse full of food which was to be sold to the French invaders against Wellington's scorched earth policy) back towards the massive defensive works which Wellington has ordered built at Torres Vedras... 2 massive 50 mile long lines of forts cutting off Lisbon and S. Portugal from the French advance. (Dec06)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>O'Brian, Patrick</b> : <font color="green">Blue at the Mizzen</font> : #20 Last in the series. Storms while rounding Cape Horn. The book is packed with action - single ship actions against much heavier Spanish frigates, the siege of a fortified harbour, the capture of a pirate. Aubrey's efforts are under appreciated by the Chilean revolutionaries, who get bogged down in infighting and politics, and are slow and stingy with payment. At the very end Aubrey is promoted to Rear Admiral of the Blue, attached to the South African squadron of the Royal Navy, which serves as an excellent closure for the book and is also a convenient excuse for Aubrey to detach himself from Chilean politics and resume active service with the Royal Navy. I loved these books and will read them all again later in life. (Nov06)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Cornwell, Bernard</b> : <font color="green">Sharpe's Gold</font> : #9  I'm enjoying Sharpe more and more. In this installment he's trying to get a great stash of Spanish gold from behind French lines back to Wellington to pay for a massive defensive wall (cutting Portugal off from the French invasion). The Spanish guerillas and the French also want the gold which is hidden in a graveyard under a dungheap which Harper dives in to retrieve it :O) I've just ordered all 15 Sean Bean Sharpe DVDs from Ebay.. I suppose that shows how much I like the books. I've also ordered 10 Geoffrey Jenkins books on Dad's recommendation... I remember the days when I used to read one book at a time :ODDD (Nov 06)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>O'Brian, Patrick</b> : <font color="green">The Hundred Days</font> : Stephen's wife Diana (irritating 2D coquette) dies in a crash when Diana's rash driving overturns their coach. Diana's death leaves Stephen completely shattered, unwilling to eat or speak for long periods of time, but he pulls himself together to foil Napoleon's latest plot, an effort to raise gold from a sect of Arabs and finance his campaign. The ending chase of the Arab gold-carrying Xebec is, as always, very nicely done.(Oct 06)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Cornwell, Bernard</b> : <font color="green">Sharpe's Eagle</font> : #8 #8 Another top tale. Fighting the French. Notorious Spain-bashing: British allies are rag-tag infantry led by lazy peacocks for officers, including a real historical event where thousands of Spanish infantry are spooked by their own musket barrage! Not much subtlety, here. Sharpe steals one of Napoleon's eagle standards from the juggernaut French infantry.(Sept 06)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Cornwell, Bernard</b> : <font color="green">Sharpe's Havoc</font> : #7 Fighting the French in Portugal in 1809 (Peninsular Campaign). Woman=Kate Savage married to Enemy=Colonel Christopher of the Foreign Office, who is busy sneaking around behind enemy lines, trying to arrange for the surrender of British troops to the perfidious French and makes the mistake of stealing Richard Sharpe's telescope. Sharpe and Harper witness a horrific bridge collapse, defend a remote mountaintop fort and lead the way for a daring British invasion of a Portuguese seminary in Oporto (Sept06)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Frank, Ann</b> : <font color="green">The Diary of a Young Girl</font> : I bought this book when Timo, Craig, Ed and I visited the Anne Frank house/museum in Amsterdam. Very interesting read from the historical/war perspective but also quite a good situation comedy/romance tale. She was typical teenage girl with all the boychasing, selfishness, moral questions that implies. Very sad that she died 3 months before her camp was liberated (Aug 06)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Cornwell, Bernard</b> : <font color="green">Sharpe's Rifles</font> : #6 Sharpe is in Spain retreating from the French who have overrun Spain and Portugal. His riflemen hate him and Harper, the Irish ringleader tries to kill him. The company gell as they help Spanish Major Don Blas Vivar recapture Santiago de Compostela, the holy city of St James, back from the French (Aug06)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>O'Brian, Patrick</b> : <font color="green">The Yellow Admiral</font> : #18 Assigned to duty on the blockade of the French city of Brest, Peace breaks out. Jack's prospects for promotion to Rear Admiral are diminished - hence the name 'Yello Admiral'. Sophie finds out about an affair Jack has and there is a fantastically sexist outcome. Jack tells her she's being stupid.. men are men and everyone backs him up. She eventually has a fling herself (to cure her frigidity) and everyone's happy :O) (Aug06)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Smith, Wilbur</b> : <font color="green">Golden Fox</font> : Crap. Rubbish. I stopped this book after 100 pages. Self indulgent dialogue about vacuous 2D upper class toffs(Jul06)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Cornwell, Bernard</b> : <font color="green">Sharpe's Prey</font> : #5 Sharpe's in Copenhagen. The British want to capture (or destroy) the Danish fleet before Napoleon can grab it for the French and thus stop imports to Britain. Sharpe is in Copnhagen when the British bombardment begins.. and of course he's after a Danish girl this time!(Jul06)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Howard, Robert E</b> : <font color="green">Eye of the Tiger</font> : Very good yarn about sunken treasure. 2D adventure fun (Jul06)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Wilson,Trevor</b> : <font color="green">The First World War</font> : Very good overview of the main events and details of The Great War. (Jul 06)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Cornwell, Bernard</b> : <font color="green">Sharpe's Trafalgar</font> : #4 Sharpe at sea! The writing is more kid's adventure than the Aubrey series but it's still a good pageturner. We meet Nelson face to face too (Jun06)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>O'Brian, Patrick</b> : <font color="green">The Commodore (2)</font> : #17 Maturin gets yellow fever and Jack is promoted to the rank of Commodore and given a squadron of ships to command. His mission is twofold -- to make a large dent in the slave trade off the coast of Africa and, on his return, to intercept a French fleet set for Bantry Bay with a cargo of weapons for the disaffected among the Irish (Jun06)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Billingham, Mark</b> : <font color="green">Scaredy Cat</font> : I really liked this book. Not sure why.. there was nothing really different or new here. Just struck a chord with a lot of the childhood memories and locations. (Jun 06)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Billingham, Mark</b> : <font color="green">Lifeless</font> : Thorne goes undercover as a homeless man in London. Very procedural. Well written and solid plot/characterisation.. still a bit lacking on the action front though (Jun 06)</li>

India again and Sharpe is helping Wellsley (Duke of Wellington) to oust the natives from a mountain fortress. Very good read again. These books are very fast paced and quick to read compared to the highly detailed Aubrey/Maturin books (May 06)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Koontz, Dean</b> : <font color="green">Forever Odd</font> : Excellent again. Odd Thomas was a very original and well written book and this sequel is very satisfying. No ranging subplots or distractions, just action led supernatural sluething with very strong characterisation. Odd Thomas is very logical and methodical when using his 'I see dead people' gift. (Apr 06)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Sharpe, Tom</b> : <font color="green">The Midden</font> : I'm reading my last 3 Sharpe's in a row before returning all 6 to Juha in 2 weeks when I visit. Not Sharpe's best effort. All the same kinky farce elements are present but there's no really good characterisation. To quote 'poorvic' (an Amazon.com reviewer) "This book is really nothing more than nastiness without a real purpose to it; money and sales seem to be the motive behind it. The constant emphasis on lesbianism and sexual escapism (and i am not a prude) are simply crude and unamusing. Shame on you Mr Sharpe for descending from brilliance into mediocrity".(Apr06)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>O'Brian, Patrick</b> : <font color="green">The Wine-Dark Sea</font> : #16 Maturin loses a few toes while hiking up the Inca trails in the Peruvian Andes. Lots of battles, prizes and good banter. Aubrey gets a few bad wounds.. his eye is nearly taken out by a piece of shot.(Mar06)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Pratchett, Terry</b> : <font color="green">Thud</font> : The dwarves and trolls fought at Koom Valley hundreds of years ago. Vimes has a new vampire girl in the watch and needs to read 'Where's my Cow?' to his son at 6pm every evening. Great Pratchett story (Feb06)</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><b>Cornwell, Bernard</b> : <font color="green">Sharpe's Triumph</font> : #2 Battle of Assaye 1803.

<li class="list-group-item"><b>Rowling, JK</b> : <font color="green">Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince</font> : The main characters are no longer particularly likeable. Hermoine's still a brat, Ron's a bully and Harry's now a very 2D 'leader of the pack'. Rowling's writing has improved (scene-setting, plot) but her characterisation is way off the mark.
